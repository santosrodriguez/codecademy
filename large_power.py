#Create a function named large_power() that takes two parameters named base and exponent.

#If base raised to the exponent is greater than 5000, return True, otherwise return False

# Write your large_power function here:
def large_power(base, exponent):
  if base ** exponent > 5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False


# Uncomment these function calls to test your large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False


#In this solution, we have an example of how the operation can be performed in the condition of the if statement. This prevents us from needing to create an extra variable. If the condition is true, then the indented code is executed which returns True, otherwise the indented code in the else statement is executed.
