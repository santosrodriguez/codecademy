#Create a function named in_range() that has three parameters named num, lower, and upper.

#The function should return True if num is greater than or equal to lower and less than or equal to upper. Otherwise, return False.


# Write your in_range function here:
def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if num >= lower and num <= upper:
    return True
  else:
    return False


# Uncomment these function calls to test your in_range function:
print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
# should print True
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))
# should print False

#In this solution, we test the two bounds connected with an and boolean operator. This means that the code nested in the if statement will only execute if both of the conditions are true. We also do not include the else statement here. Since our if statement will return True and exit the function if the condition is true, the last line will only be reached if the condition was false.
