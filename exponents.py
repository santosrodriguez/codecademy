#Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers. Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.

#For example, consider the following code.

#exponents([2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
#the result would be the list [2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 27, 4, 16, 64]. It would first add two to the first. Then two to the second. Then two to the third, and so on.

def exponents(bases, powers):
  new_lst = []
  for base in bases:
    for power in powers:
      new_lst.append(base ** power)
  return new_lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(exponents([2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]))

#As you can see in this solution, we used two nested for loops so that, for every base, we iterate through every power. This allows us to raise each base to every single power in our list and append the answers to our new list. Finally, we return the list of answers.
